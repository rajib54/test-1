We will be grading based on:

1) generic design

3) unit testing
4) documentation


during interview We will add follow up questions, and will request an upgrade to the program.

This test should take between 30 - 90 minutes.

Fork this repo, and submit you test via pull request.

This test is implemented in Java. To run in command prompt please run Main.java file in src/com/toufiq/main folder.
In windows if you have java setup from src folder you can run java com.toufiq.main.Main.
